<p style="color:purple;font-size=100%;">Practicing HTML is fun. <em>So far</em> we have learned <strong>HTML</strong> is a language
   <br>made of tags that help us describe how we want our webpage to look. We have tried the head,
   <br>title, H(heading) and paragraph tags so far. Very few peopleknow all the tags in HTML, but 
   <br>that is okay because we can do a lot with just some basic tags. We can learn about new tags 
   <br>when we need them.
